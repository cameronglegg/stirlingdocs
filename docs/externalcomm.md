# What is the best methos to speak with Steve?

These are many methods of communication available to you. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. Since [**Steve**](mailto:steve@stirlingwoodworks.com) is often driving :blue_car: some work better than others.

:::caution We can all use this guide

While this document mentions [**Steve**](mailto:steve@stirlingwoodworks.com) specifially, the same timelines are expected of all members of Stirling Woodworks.

:::

## The following is a list and when they should be used:

1. **The Phone Call:** [:telephone: :iphone: :telephone_receiver:](tel:604-720-2726)

:::tip

Generally you can expect a response immediately or within a few minutes

:::

The phone call can be used at any time it is very effective and Steve can answer while driving, **DO NOT BE AFFAID TO CALL STEVE!!** The only "dumb questions" are the ones that are not asked. If Steve can not answer the phone because he is on another call of in a meeting **LEAVE A MESSAGE**. Steve gets voice message converted to text so if he’s in a meeting he may be able to read the message. The phone call is the best choice if you have a question and will slow you down if you don’t get an answer right away.

2. **Teams messages:**

:::tip

You may get a response within a few minutes or that day

:::

Teams: messages are a great way to keep track of conversations and are very useful if Steve is at his computer. Unfortunately, he does not receive these while driving. So these should be used when it is important to keep track of the conversation but may not work if a response is needed urgently.

3. **Teams Calls:**

:::tip

You may get a response immediately or within a few minutes

:::

Teams calls are similar to teams messages.

4. **Teams Video calls:**

:::tip

You may get a response immediately or within a few minutes

:::

These are helpful to explain things on the jobsite. **Use this feature!** If you want to video call Steve and you don’t get a response he might be driving. If this is the case call him and he will pull over to take the video call.

5. **Email:**

:::tip

You may get a response that day.

:::

:::caution

This is not for urgent communication  

:::

Email is a great tool to use when we are communicating outside the company. Use this method if the content may need to be forwarded to someone outside the company.

6. **Text messages:** 

:::tip

You may get a response immediately or within a few minutes

:::

Although text message should be a last resort this might be a good option if you need an urgent response. Steve does receive and can reply to text messages while driving.
