## I found the address. Now what!?

Find a good place to park that is as close to the entry as possible if there are vehicles in the way ask politely but **FIRMLY** to have them moved. 

:::note

Remember that you are working for Stirling Woodworks not the GC, electrician, drywaller, painter or the plumber.

## Where does all this stuff go?

The easiest way to sort out what goes where is to Use the drawings provided by the shop to locate exactly where the millwork goes.

If the drawings provided by Stirling do not contain a layout of the house, the General Contractor will have a floor plan available somewhere on site.

:::tip

This is a good time to plan your route. Less walking will cut down on your fatigue and save the company money. Nice!

:::

## What should the site look like when I arrive?

Make sure the area is clear. Our contract states that our work area must be clean and ready for us. If it is not, politely but **FIRMLY**, ask the general contractor and other trades working in the area to clean up.

Proceed with the delivery once the area is cleared.

:::important

Help the General Contractor clear the area if you have the time.

But remember! Every minute we do work thatâ€™s not part of our scope it is **costing the company money**.

:::

## What do I do with this extra set of drawings?

Take the drawings and tape them to wall in the areas the cabinets go. Try to put them in a spot where they can stay, and where they will not damage any finished walls.

:::tip

Use **Green** masking tape for finished walls. It has very little adhesive, so you have the least chance of damaging someone elses work.

:::

## What about the floor protection?

Clear the area where the cabinets will be installed and carefully remove and floor protection just under the cabinets. Don't forget to Vaccum the floor under the protection, this ensures that Stirling is not responsible for any damage.
