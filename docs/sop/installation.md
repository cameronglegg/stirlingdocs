## Installation Introduction

Installation is one of the hardest areas of our business. You are responsible for many things. Inlcuding but not limited to:

* Being a brand ambassador
* Ensuring that the products from the shop are assembled and installed in timely manner
* Installing the products to a minumum standard of structural integrity. _We would hate for a door to fall on someones foot, or worse._

That is only naming a few, it is a complex position and you will be called on to provide value in many different and challenging ways. Because of this we have set out to identify and communication some key strategies for success. 

## Standard Operating Procedure

### Job Start

1. Review the drawings the day before you scheduled to be on site with the shop foreman and the project manager If you are unsure of anything or need clarification it is your responsibility to ask the project manager.

2. Confirm the hours that we can work on site our standard work hours are from 7:30 to 4:00 with a 15-minute break in the morning and ½ hour lunch break and 15-minute break in the afternoon.

3. Inform the GC or owner when and what time you will arrive. 

4. One of the most important things to remember is that you are the first point of contact for everyone on site. Including but not limited to **the client** _(General Contractor, Home Owner, or otherwise)_. So please Arrive on site **dressed appropriately in a Stirling Woodworks T shirt.**

:::important Be Respectful

When communicating with people on site wether they are clients or employees of Stirling, be respectful and courteous.

5. Make sure the site is clean and ready to go if not ask the other trades and the GC to clean the site, it is in our agreement that the site must clean and ready for us to work effectively. Make sure the **floors are protected**. This is also the GC/owners responsibility. If it is not done do not continue until it is. **If the floor gets damaged it will be our fault**. If the GC or owner are unable to protect the floor notify them that we will do it **on a time material basis**.

6. Make sure you have the [equipment you need.](toollist.md)

### Drawings

7. Check that you have the most current set of drawings and that they have been taped to the wall if not tape them to the wall.

8. Check that the actual dimensions match the drawings 

### Receiving Deliveries

9. Check that you have all of the cabinets, fillers and panels you need. If you don’t let the [**project manager**](mailto:cameron@stirlingwoodworks.com) as soon as possible.

10. Remove all doors and drawers if this has not already been done

### Installation Prep

11. Use a **stud finder** to locate the Studs.

12. Check the level of the floor and ceiling with a laser level

13. Start installing the cabinets from a wall or corner level them then screw them to the wall. Where possible screw several cabinets together level them then screw them to the wall. Use **2 ½” screws** to attached cabinets to walls and **1 ¼** to screw them together.

14. When screwing cabinets together place the screws just in front of the hinge plate when possible typically place them where it will be difficult to see them.

There should be a **minimum** of **two screws** in the front edge of upper and lower cabinets. Try to put screws about 1 ¼” ( in line with the line boring), from the front face and 2” from the top and bottom there should also be one screws in the top back corner and one in the lower back corner. This so the cabinets won’t pull apart if they are aren’t perfectly level or flat against the wall.

15. Drill plumbing holes with a hole **2 3/8” hol saw** or **1” spade bit** when possible. 

16. Install end panels and back panels.

17. Install fillers and reveals. Use an 1/8 MDF template for trickier fillers.

18. Install false fronts and in the case of screw on drawer fronts before the counter tops go on

19. Install kicks.

20. Install fast caps on all visible screws. Do not install fast caps on screws you won’t see when the installation is complete.

21. If we are installing the countertops this the time to do that. It is often much easier to make a template out of 1/8” MDF glued together with a glue gun and transfer that to the countertop.

:::note

Take photos **daily** and post them on teams so every knows the progress on site. These can also be used to document that there was no damage on our work at the time of completion.
