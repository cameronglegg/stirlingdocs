## Generating and Re-Generating Proposals

Once you have generated a propsal, it is no longer tied to your Estimate. If you change the Estimate you will have to create a new proposal.

You can have as many proposals as you want so don't hesitate to make a new one once you have made a change.

Each line item is generated based on the Room name and description, you set this up earlier in the Job Description area. If you want to add a note to a room, it is best to go back and add it into that area. That way when you create a new proposal it will be added automatically.

:::note

Remember to remove the "-- Room:" off of Installation and Delivery.

## Remarks

If there are any specific remarks that need to be added, do that here.

## Sending the proposal off

Now that you have a proposal that you are happy with and you have **double checked it with Steve** you can "Open a Printable PDF", save it to our Quotation folder in Sharepoint (change the name to reflect the porposal number), then sned it in an email to the client.

:::tip

You can click on the clients email in the pdf to create a new email with there address.
