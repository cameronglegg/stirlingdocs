## How to Take Time Off
Going on Vacation? Take a look at the Staff Holiday calendar to ensure not everyone will be away, then let Steve and Cam know! Once your time off has been approved, input it into the holiday calendar. 

## How to create an "Out of Office" message
It's helpful to let your contacts know that you are away.

In Outlook:
- File -> Automatic Replies
- Select: Send automatic replies. Then select the Start and End  Times. 
  - Be sure to include the range of dates you will be away (ie. September 21-October 11). It is also helpful to include contact information for someone to contact in lieu of you. 

Your message should be placed under the "Inside my Organization" and "Outside my Organization" tabs.

In Teams: 
1. Click on your Avatar in the top right hand corner. 
    - Select: Set status message
    - Type your message. Please include the range of dates you will be away. Maybe even @ someone to contact in lieu of you. 
    - Select a day to clear the status message, ideally the day you will be back. 

## How to have your email forwarded
In Outlook 
  - File
    - Rules and Alerts
      - Start from a blank rule - Apply rule on messages I receive
        - Select: sent to only me OR from people of public group
          - Select: forward it to people or public group.
              ::: Note: in "Step 2" select the highlighted "people or public group" :::
              - Then select who you want your emails forwarded   from/to whom.
