## Why do we clean?
In order to be efficient in our jobs, we need to start with a clean work space. 
Not only does this help reduce the chance of misplacing things we need, but it also ensures we have a safe working environment. 
We are also using the time we clean to make sure all of the tools and machinery we use are in working order and have no maintence issues.

Regular, thorough cleaning reduces downtime and increases our efficiency.

## When do we clean? Why?
We get it, no enjoys cleaning, but we all know it's a necessary part of life. 

That's why we don't leave cleaning until last thing on Friday. We make sure we clean up everything, every single morning. 

Cleaning in the morning gives everyone the same opportunity to ensure their workspace is clean and their machinery and tools are where they need to be and functioning properly. 


## What do we clean?
Short answer: Everything. 

1. Machinery
    - Working with wood means there will be dust. Lots of dust. Dust is also a combustible material, which means we all must be diligent in ensuring all machinery is thoroughly cleaned of all dust and debris. 
2. Floors
    - I don't know about you but I don't enjoy slipping and tripping things. In order to effectively do our jobs, we need to ensure we have a clear pathway which means there is nothing blocking our routes and nothing on the floors causing hazards.
