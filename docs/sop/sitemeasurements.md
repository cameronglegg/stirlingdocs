<!-- This is an MDX script that you add a highlight colour to text. Just add the "<Highlight>sample text</Highlight>" and set the Hex Value for your "color" inline, and voila! -->

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => ( <span style={{

## What is Site Measurement?

The purpose of site measurements at Sitrling Woodworks is to ensure that all products fit exactly within the physical constraints of the clients space.

We create highly customized products and those products are often in variable locations with many physical constraints that lead to the final design. It is incredibly important that our site measurements are carried out thoroughly with laser percision (literally).

The reason that we carry out these exhaustive site measurements is to ensure that when the installation teams attempts to install the product there are no issues fitting the product into the space.

Things Like:

* Does the product fit through the front door?
* Do all of the pieces fit inside the elevator?
* Will the flooring or wall covering thickness interfere with any of the reveals of the product.

## What tools are needed to carry out a sucessful site measurement?

1. The most recent version of Stirling Woodworks drawings
2. Tape Measure
3. Laser Measuring Device

:::note

This can either be your own personal laser measuring device or Stirling owns a Leica Laser that can be taken to site.

4. Lazer Level
5. Pen or Pencil

:::caution

If you plan on creating digital markups pease see the [Digital Markup documentation.](digimark.md)

## Who should carry out the Site Measurement?

All site measurement should be carried out by <Highlight color="#db3125">the person creating the drawings.</Highlight> This means that the engineer creating the drawings will have to schedule a time to go through the site with either the site supervisor or the client.

## Dependancies

So we know why we need to site measure, we have all of the necessary tools but how do we make sure that we have all of the information that wee need.

Often when we initially make a site visit there are a few questions that we need to know in order to have all of the information we need to carry out our site measurement.

Here is an example of a few of those questions:

* What is the wall covering in this room?
* What is the flooring thickness in this room, and is there a specific height that the floor is being leveled too?
* What is the casing thickness?

There as so many variables that it would be impossible to cover them all here so use your judgement and try to ask as many questions as possible
