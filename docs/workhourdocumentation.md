## Hours of Operation
We work Monday to Friday, and rarely some weekends when the job needs to be completed. 
Generally speaking, employees are expected to be at their respective place of work by 7:30am, and the expectation is that they are done work at 4:00pm every day. 

Occasionally, there is work that is out of town and overnight stays are required. 

Coffee break: 9:30-9:45am
Lunch: 12:00-12:30pm
Afternoon Coffee: 2:45-3:00pm

## How to record your hours
Every other friday you are responsible for having your hours updated in the timesheets folder in the Stirling OneDrive file. If your hours are not filled out, [Debbie](mailto:accounting@stirlingwoodworks.com) gets sad when she cannot pay you. Do not make Debbie sad. Fill out your hours and get paid! 

## Payday
You know how we just went over filling out time sheets every friday? Well, the other fridays of the month are payday. Yay! 

That means every Friday there is something to look forward to - either getting paid or making sure you get paid!
