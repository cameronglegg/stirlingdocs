## What is Apprenticeship

An apprenticeship is a great way to gain hands-on experience and valuable skills in a trade or profession. You will start an apprenticeship with on-the-job training, followed by 4x 6 week periods of in-class technical training spread over 4 years. This is done while you continue to work and get paid.
